## Building from Source

If you want to build the library from source you just have clone the source from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rometools/rome), change into the project directory 
and install the package using the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rometools/rome.git
cd rome

# Linux
./mvnw install

# Windows
mvnw install
```
