## ROME Development Process

We\'re welcoming our first external developer, [Nick
Lothian](http://www.mackmo.com/nick/blog/){.externalLink} today, so we
thought it would be good to set a few basic rules for this project. We
don\'t want to be too formal, since we\'re still alpha, and trust our
developer\'s common sense to \"do the right thing\".

-   Please before commiting anything send an email in the rome developer
    lists to explain what you want to do
-   When you create some new code, please javadoc it, and unit tests are
    welcome
-   If your code involves new functionality for end users, please
    document it on the wiki.
-   and update the [RomeChangesLog](./ChangeLog.html)
-   I think that\'s it: Welcome to Rome
