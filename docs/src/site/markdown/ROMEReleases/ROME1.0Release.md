## ROME 1.0 Release

*ROME 1.0 was released on March 12, 2009*

### What is New / Highlights

Normally each release of ROME includes a whole new set of Wiki pages
with the corresponding version number. ROME 1.0 is reusing wikis from
previous versions as there are not significant changes.

-   ROME can now optionally preserve WireFeed (ie, Atom/RSS specific)
    data and make it available via the SyndFeed data model. See
    [PreservingWireFeeds](../PreservingWireFeeds.html) for further
    details

-   Complete details in the [change log](../ChangeLog.html)
