## Rome v0.2 Tutorials

The following tutorials show how to use the Rome API. They focus on the
higher abstraction layer of classes offered by Rome, what we call the
Synd\* classes. By using the Synd\* classes developers don\'t have to
deal with the specifics of any syndication feed. They work with
normalized feeds, the Synd\* feeds. This makes it much easier to write
applications that have to deal with all the variety of syndication feed
types in use today.

    feed](./RomeV0.2TutorialUsingRomeToReadASyndicationFeed.html)
2.  [Using Rome to convert a syndication feed from one type to
    another](./RomeV0.2TutorialUsingRomeToConvertASyndicationFeedFromOneTypeToAnother.html)
3.  [Using Rome to aggregate many syndication feeds into a single
    one](./RomeV0.2TutorialUsingRomeToAggregateManySyndicationFeedsIntoASingleOne.html)

The instructions for building and running the samples are identical to
theÂ [instructions for Rome
v0.1](../../ROME0.1Beta/RomeV0.1Tutorials/RomeV0.1HowToBuildAndRunTheTutorialsSampleCode.html).
