## ROME and OSGI

From ROME 1.0 RC2 onwards, the ROME jar includes OSGi information in its
manifest.

Note that we have received some reports that ROME plugin classloading
may cause problems with OSGi. Setting the system property
\"rome.pluginmanager.useloadclass\" to \"true\" may help avoid this. See
[Issue 118](http://java.net/jira/browse/ROME-118) for
further information.
