## Getting Started

The following pages show how to use the ROME API. They focus on the higher 
abstraction layer of classes offered by ROME, what we call the Synd* classes. 
By using the Synd* classes developers don't have to deal with the specifics of 
any syndication feed. They work with normalized feeds, the Synd* feeds. This 
makes it much easier to write applications that have to deal with all the 
variety of syndication feed types in use today.
