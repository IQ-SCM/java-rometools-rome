## Tutorials and Articles

### Tutorials

The following tutorials show how to use the ROME API. They focus on the
higher abstraction layer of classes offered by ROME, what we call the
Synd\* classes. By using the Synd\* classes developers don\'t have to
deal with the specifics of any syndication feed. They work with
normalized feeds, the Synd\* feeds. This makes it much easier to write
applications that have to deal with all the variety of syndication feed
types in use today.
