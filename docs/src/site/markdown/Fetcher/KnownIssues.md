### Version 0.3

-   The Maven build does not run the `jetty` tests because of a bug in
    Maven
-   Version 0.3 does not have `Xerces` included in the project.xml (it
    is required to run the samples). Either get the latest `project.xml`
    from CVS, or [patch it
    yourself](https://rome.dev.java.net/source/browse/rome/subprojects/fetcher/project.xml?r1=1.1&r2=1.2){.externalLink}
-   0.3 had a bug that caused it to overwite system properties.

### Version 0.5

-   When listening to feed events using `FetcherListener`, there is no
    way to get to the retrieved content, because it is set after firing
    the event. \--

-   When listening to feed events using `FetcherListener`, the feed URLs
    returned by the `FetcherEvent` are prepended with
    \"sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection:\" \--

### Version 0.7

-   `HashMapFeedInfoCache` doesn\'t work quite right because
    `URL.hashCode()` does hostname resolution and treats virtual hosts
    with the same IP as equal, so e.g. all RSS feeds from `blogspot.com`
    collide in the cache. Also, it\'s really slow. Fix is to use
    `URL.toExternalForm()` as the hash key instead of the URL itself.
